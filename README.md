# React my photos

(Work in progress)

I am really interested in Metaverse. This project is a starting point for me to study every technology required for Metaverse.

First, I have just started studying React by reading this e-book:

## Project plan

1. Study React basics
2. Study Heroku basics
3. Develop Photo app with React
4. Develop REST API services on Heroku
5. Integrate them
6. Migrate from js version to ts version

Then, I am going to study three.js and WebRTC for 2D & 3D WWW.
